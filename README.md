# Project-Rahat
A Desktop Software for helping Flood affected people to be used at flood relief camp.

## Floods
Floods are a major issue in many parts of India such as West Bengal, Orrisa, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujrat, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Kerala.
These floods lead to a lot of destruction, people are left homeless, many get injured and rescue operations proceed to save them and provide them shelter in camps. These camps are organized by NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) teams.

## Use case of software
This software provides a modern way of managing all the activities in camps, and focuses on the needs and demands of people, their health, status, feedback etc. This also tries to unite all those people who got separated from their families during the floods.

This also helps government to get a very reliable data, on which they can depend on and can make estimations of the money to distribute to affected people. This software also enables the efficient utilisation of resources by the camps, enables them share resources like medicines with each other and hence enabling government to utilise the money allotted for the flood affected people in correct way, by making correct estimates. The remaining money can be either utilised in upraising the standard of studies for children in camp or in distributing to the affected people.

This software has been developed using PostgreSQL, Python, PyCharm, and PyQt5 from scratch.
