HIGH PRIORITY: convert all column names using _(underscore) when space required and reflect the same in code
eg: camp_id camp_name

line 206: SysAdmin.py
# fill my camp info using query_data variable

tables that need changes:
my_camp_info                    (in each camp)
campdetYEAR (campdet2021)       [in all_camp_details]
demandYEAR (demand2021)
feedbackYEAR (feedback2021)
support_membersYEAR (support_members2021)

alter table my_camp_info
rename COLUMN campid to camp_id;

alter table my_camp_info
rename COLUMN campName to camp_name;
